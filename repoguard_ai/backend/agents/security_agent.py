"""
Security Assessment Agent
---------------------------
Implements the paper's "Security Assessment Agent" (Section III-B):
identifies vulnerability classes such as injection, insecure
deserialization, weak cryptography, and hardcoded secrets, and grounds
each finding in Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers.

Detection combines AST inspection (for call-based patterns, which is
robust to formatting) with targeted regular expressions (for patterns
such as hardcoded secrets that are easier to express lexically). This
mirrors the paper's description of "LLM-based security reasoning
together with security knowledge derived from vulnerability
taxonomies" -- here the taxonomy lookup (CWE mapping) is deterministic,
while the pattern set stands in for the reasoning step so the agent is
fully reproducible without external API calls.
