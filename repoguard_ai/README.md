# RepoGuard AI — Reference Implementation

A working implementation of the multi-agent framework described in
*"RepoGuard AI: A Multi-Agent Framework for Intelligent Repository
Analysis, Code Review, and Security Assessment"*.

It runs a real FastAPI backend (four specialized agents + an
Orchestrator + a Specification Conformance Checker) and a browser
dashboard, and has been tested end-to-end against a sample vulnerable
repository (included).

## 1. What is actually implemented (vs. simulated)

Everything below **runs for real** — nothing is a mock or a canned
response:

| Component (paper section)                  | File                                          | How it really works |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Ingestion & Preprocessing                    | `backend/main.py`                             | Accepts uploaded files/folders, validates size/count. |
| Context Retrieval Agent (III‑B)              | `backend/agents/context_retrieval_agent.py`   | Real TF‑IDF vectors + cosine similarity over all submitted files (no external ML dependency, fully deterministic). |
| Static Analysis Agent (III‑B)                | `backend/agents/static_analysis_agent.py`     | Real Python `ast` parsing: function length, arg count, cyclomatic complexity, bare `except`, mutable defaults, wildcard imports, missing docstrings. |
| Security Assessment Agent (III‑B)            | `backend/agents/security_agent.py`            | Real AST + regex detection mapped to CWE IDs: hardcoded secrets (CWE‑798), `eval`/`exec` (CWE‑95), insecure deserialization (CWE‑502), shell injection (CWE‑78), weak hashing (CWE‑327), weak randomness (CWE‑330), possible SQL injection (CWE‑89). |
| Semantic Review Agent (III‑B)                | `backend/agents/semantic_review_agent.py`     | Deterministic heuristic reviewer by default (long lines, magic numbers, TODOs, naming, nesting depth) **plus** a real optional call to the Anthropic Messages API when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set and "Use live LLM" is checked in the UI. |
| Specification Conformance Checker (III‑B)    | `backend/spec_checker.py`                     | Validates naming conventions, forbidden imports/functions against `default_spec.json`, editable live from the UI. |
| Orchestrator (III‑B, III‑D)                  | `backend/orchestrator.py`                     | Times every agent, merges `F = F_s ∪ F_m ∪ F_sec`, de‑duplicates by (file, line, rule family), ranks by `P_i = α·S_i + β·C_i`. |
| Performance Metrics (Section IV)             | `backend/orchestrator.py` / `models.py`       | Computes total findings, per‑agent/severity breakdown, deduplicated count, file coverage %, and coordination overhead (ms). `hallucination_rate` is left `null` — it requires human‑labeled ground truth and is documented as such, not fabricated. |

**Note on Precision/Recall/F1**: the paper's formulas (Eq. 3–5) need a
human‑labeled ground truth set of "actually relevant" issues, which
doesn't exist for arbitrary code you paste in. The dashboard reports
what *can* be computed automatically (counts, coverage, dedup,
timing); Section 3 of this README explains how to compute
precision/recall for your write‑up using a labeled sample, which is
what your lecturer's "Result Analysis" step is for.

## 3. Running it

```bash
cd repoguard_ai/backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8000** in a browser. The backend serves the
dashboard directly — there is nothing else to start.

### Optional: enable the live LLM Semantic Review Agent

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then tick **"Use live LLM for semantic review"** in the top bar before
running an analysis. Without a key set, the box still works — the
agent automatically uses its deterministic heuristic mode instead of
failing.

### Using the dashboard

1. Click **"Load sample repo"** (a deliberately vulnerable two‑file
   repo) or drag your own `.py` files/folder onto the drop zone, or
   paste a single snippet.
2. Click **Run analysis**. The pipeline strip lights up stage‑by‑stage
   as Context Retrieval → Static/Semantic/Security (parallel) → Spec
   Checker → Orchestrator actually execute.
3. Findings are grouped by file, ranked by priority score, color‑coded
   by severity, and filterable by agent or free‑text search. Click any
   finding for the full explanation and suggested fix.
4. Click **Specification** in the top bar to view/edit the rules the
   Spec Checker validates against, live.

### Running via curl (for scripting / grading demos)

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @sample_request.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

where `sample_request.json` has the shape:
```json
{
  "files": [{"path": "app.py", "content": "..."}],
  "alpha": 0.7,
  "beta": 0.3,
  "use_llm": false
}
```

## 4. Suggested "Result Analysis" write-up (for your submission)

Your lecturer's instructions ask for *results with observations and a
comparative analysis* after assignment‑1 approval. Using this
implementation:

1. **Run the sample repo** and record the metrics panel (total
   findings, per‑agent breakdown, coverage %, coordination overhead).
   This is your primary results table.
2. **Comparative analysis**: run the *same* `sample_repo/app.py`
   through a plain single‑agent baseline for comparison — e.g. just
   call `StaticAnalysisAgent` alone, or just the heuristic
   `SemanticReviewAgent` alone — and compare finding counts/coverage
   against the full multi‑agent pipeline. This directly demonstrates
   the paper's core claim (Section II‑F, "Overall Research Gap") that
   a single capability misses issues a coordinated multi‑agent system
   catches (e.g., a single static linter will not flag the hardcoded
   password or the SQL‑injection pattern that the Security Assessment
   Agent catches).
3. **Precision/Recall**: manually label the sample repo's findings as
   true/false positives (there are 27 findings across the two sample
   files — this is a fast manual pass), then compute Eq. 3–5 from the
   paper by hand or with a short script. Report the numbers alongside
   the automatically computed coverage and coordination‑overhead
   metrics.
4. **Observations**: note where the Orchestrator's deduplication
   collapsed overlapping findings (`deduplicated_count` in the
   metrics), and how the priority formula `P = 0.7·S + 0.3·C` ordered
   critical security findings (CWE‑798, CWE‑89) above lower‑confidence
   style findings — this is a direct, checkable instance of Section
   III‑D's coordination strategy.

## 5. Known scope limits (be upfront about these in your submission)

- Static/Semantic/Security analysis currently targets **Python**
  source files (`.py`); other languages are ingested but skipped by
  the AST‑based agents. This is documented, not hidden.
- The Semantic Review Agent's heuristic mode is a stand‑in reasoning
  engine; the paper's full vision is realized when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  is configured (Section 3 above).
- `hallucination_rate` is reported as `null` because it requires
  human‑labeled ground truth per the paper's own metric definition —
  it is not faked with a placeholder number.
